# Machine Learning Models for Probability Classification in Spectrographic EEG Seizures Dataset

Abstract

Significance: Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis for seizure detection poses significant challenges due to the complex nature of brain signals. Deep learning models offer the potential to automate this complex process, but their accuracy and reliability remain key challenges.

Aim and Approach: This study aims to enhance EEG seizure probability classification by integrating transfer learning with EfficientNetV2 architectures (EfficientNetV2S and EfficientNetV2B2), specialized convolutional layers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, and fine-tuned attention mechanisms. This approach leverages the strengths of pre-trained models while customizing layers to capture the EEG's intricate patterns.

Results & Conclusions: The top-performing model achieved 86.45% accuracy with a Kullback-Leibler Divergence loss of 0.95, demonstrating its capacity for accurate and confident seizure predictions. Integrating convolutional and LSTM layers improved performance, effectively capturing spatial-temporal patterns in EEG data. While attention mechanisms offered benefits, hardware limitations were also observed with increasing model complexity. These findings underscore the importance of model customisation against specific dataset characteristics and computational constraints.
